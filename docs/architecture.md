# Architecture

This MCP server bridges Portainer's REST API to MCP clients. It is
bootstrapped from the Portainer OpenAPI spec at startup — almost no
hand-written tool surface — with a small filtering and response-shaping
layer applied uniformly to every tool.

```

## Components

### Spec & tool generation — `server.py`

`build_server()` loads `src/portainer_mcp/data/portainer-patched.yaml` (a
locally-patched copy of Portainer's EE OpenAPI spec, bundled into the
wheel and read via `importlib.resources`) and hands it to
`FastMCP.from_openapi` with a shared `httpx.AsyncClient`. Under stdio the
client carries the operator's `X-API-KEY` directly; under HTTP it carries no
baked key — a per-request hook injects each caller's own key (see *HTTP auth*).
Each operation becomes an MCP tool.

### Tag filter — `profiles.py`

The spec exposes ~380 operations across 40+ tags — too noisy for a model
to navigate. Profiles are named bundles of tags (e.g. `DOCKER`,
`KUBERNETES`). `PORTAINER_PROFILES` selects which to enable; the union
of their tags becomes a `RouteMap` per tag (FastMCP intersects multi-tag
`RouteMap`s, so we emit one per tag). `PORTAINER_READ_ONLY=1` further
restricts the surface to `GET`/`HEAD`.

### Proxy tools — `proxy.py`

Two hand-written tools — `docker_proxy` and `kubernetes_proxy` — forward
arbitrary paths under `/endpoints/{id}/docker/...` and
`/endpoints/{id}/kubernetes/...`. These paths aren't enumerated in the
OpenAPI spec (Portainer forwards them as a subpath to the underlying
daemon), so they can't be generated. Each tool validates the path (no
`..`, no `?#`) and blocks auth-bypass headers.

### Tool annotations — `readOnlyHint`

Every tool is stamped with the MCP `readOnlyHint` annotation so clients can
relax approval prompts for non-mutating calls. OpenAPI tools derive it from
the HTTP method via the `mcp_component_fn` hook passed to
`FastMCP.from_openapi` — `GET`/`HEAD` are read-only, everything else is a
write. Setting the hint `False` (rather than leaving it unset) on writes
also activates the spec's `destructiveHint` default, so mutating methods
need no per-method enumeration. The two proxy tools carry the flag via
decorator instead: `readOnlyHint` tracks `PORTAINER_READ_ONLY`, which is
honest because the proxy hard-rejects non-`GET` requests in read-only mode.
`SelectArgTransform` re-wraps every tool but inherits the parent's
annotations, so the hint survives the `select` injection. The hint is a
client-side UX signal, not enforcement — the server's actual read-only
guarantee is the `GET`/`HEAD` `RouteMap` restriction and the proxy's
method check.

### HTTP auth — `auth.py` and `passthrough.py`

Only relevant when `PORTAINER_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. HTTP is **per-user
passthrough**, not a shared upstream identity: there is no mode flag, and a
shared `PORTAINER_API_KEY` over HTTP is a hard-fail misconfiguration (it's the
stdio-only credential). Two layered checks run on every request, both inside
`PassthroughVerifier.verify_token` so a failure 401s before any tool dispatch:

1. **Front gate.** `build_server()` reads `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, validates
   it (min 32 chars, ASCII printable, no whitespace, loud-fail on any defect),
   and the verifier constant-time-compares the request's `Authorization: Bearer`
   against it (`hmac.compare_digest`). A miss returns `None` → FastMCP renders
   401 + `WWW-Authenticate`. The gate stops credential-less floods at a cheap
   local 401 before they reach Portainer. It has exactly one alternative — the
   trust-proxy auth posture below — and never a silent opt-out.
2. **Per-user validation.** The caller's own Portainer key rides in a separate
   `X-Portainer-API-Key` header. The verifier validates it against
   `GET /users/me?noEndpointAuthorizations=true` (`passthrough.validate`) and
   only on success admits the request, capturing `id/username` for the
   audit log. Missing key → `no_user_key`; invalid/unreachable → `invalid_user_key`;
   both 401, with no fallback to a shared key.

The validated key is then injected upstream as `X-API-KEY` by an httpx request
hook (`passthrough.inject_api_key`) that reads **only** the in-flight request,
so one caller can never borrow another's key, and **fails closed** (raises)
rather than ever sending a keyless upstream call. The two headers carry
*distinct* credentials — the gate token (`Authorization`, verified, never
forwarded) and the per-user key (`X-Portainer-API-Key`, validated, forwarded) —
so the verified credential and the forwarded one are never the same value.

Validation is cached positive-only (`ValidationCache`, keyed by the SHA-256 of
the key, never the raw key) for `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_CACHE_TTL` seconds (default
60). This collapses a session to one upstream `/users/me` per key per window;
the front gate keeps the miss path from being an open amplifier. The TTL is a
performance/DoS knob, not the authorization boundary — Portainer still rejects
a revoked key on every real upstream call, so a stale entry lets a dead key
pass the door for at most one window but never *act*. Negatives are never
cached so a freshly minted key isn't locked out.

Stdio transport short-circuits the auth path entirely (`_get_auth_context()` in
FastMCP) and keeps the single baked `X-API-KEY`. The verifier emits structured
audit records on the `portainer_mcp.audit` sub-logger carrying the per-request
context (see below). `ok` fires only on a *validation* — a cache miss that
round-trips `/users/me` — so it marks a validation event (~one per key per TTL
window), not every admitted request; cache hits admit silently. The failure
outcomes `mismatch` / `no_user_key` / `invalid_user_key` are uncached and fire
on every failing request. The attempted gate-token bytes and the per-user key
are **never** logged (regression-tested).

### Auth posture — `auth_posture.py`

An identity-aware proxy that performs the MCP OAuth flow (e.g. Pomerium in
MCP server mode) mints its own access token and *owns* the `Authorization`
header on the upstream request — a static gate token cannot survive that hop
([#76](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/issues/76)). `resolve()`
runs at startup (mirroring `tls.resolve_posture`) and requires **exactly one**
auth posture; both or neither refuse to boot:

- **Gate token** (default) — `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, the flow above.
- **Trust-proxy auth** — `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_AUTH=1`. The bearer value
  is ignored entirely (`TrustedProxyVerifier`; a small pre-auth middleware
  injects a placeholder when the proxy strips `Authorization` outright, since
  the SDK's bearer backend 401s header-less requests before `verify_token`).
  What replaces the gate compare is per-request proof the request transited
  the proxy, in one of two shapes.

The two shapes exist because uvicorn's proxy-header middleware rewrites
`scope["client"]` from `X-Forwarded-For` for connections arriving from
`PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` — so "check the socket peer" and "trust
the proxy's forwarded headers" are mutually exclusive signals:

1. **Inherited** (TLS-terminating proxy, the common shape): requires
   `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_TLS=1` + `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`; no extra
   variable. The attestation is `scheme == "https"`: uvicorn sets it only
   from a trusted peer's `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and this shape holds no cert,
   so a direct connection can never present it. Because "holds no cert" is
   load-bearing, `TLS_CERT` set alongside this shape is a startup error —
   a server-held cert would let every direct TLS connection self-attest.
   A wildcard in `FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` (`*` or a zero-prefix network like
   `0.0.0.0/0`) is likewise a startup error here — inheritance turns that
   list into the auth boundary.
2. **Socket peer** (server-terminated TLS, end-to-end encrypted):
   `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_AUTH_IPS=<ip/cidr,…>` names the proxy
   directly; `resolve()` returns `proxy_headers: False` so uvicorn never
   rewrites the peer, and the verifier checks `scope["client"]` against the
   allowlist (`PeerMatcher`; wildcard and non-IP entries hard-fail).
   Incompatible with `TRUST_PROXY_TLS`/`FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` (the rewrite
   would corrupt the peer signal) and requires `TLS_CERT`/`_TLS_KEY` on a
   non-loopback bind.

Degenerate combinations all hard-fail: gate token + trust flag (ambiguous),
trust flag + plaintext opt-out (the per-user key would be the only credential
and it must not cross plaintext), trust flag without
`PORTAINER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` on a non-loopback bind, and
`TRUSTED_PROXY_AUTH_IPS` without the trust flag (silently dead security
config). Failed attestation
audits as `untrusted_peer` / `untrusted_scheme` (per-request, uncached), and
every audit record under this posture carries `auth_posture: "trust_proxy"`.
The per-user `X-Portainer-API-Key` floor is untouched in both postures —
trust-proxy auth drops the *gate*, never authentication — and IP/scheme
attestation is weaker than a secret in flat container networks: the operator
owns keeping the proxy the only workload that can reach the bind address.

### HTTP security — `http_security.py`

Only relevant when `PORTAINER_MCP_TRANSPORT=http`. FastMCP doesn't plumb
the MCP SDK's `TransportSecuritySettings` through to its streamable-HTTP
manager, so DNS-rebinding protection is silently off in the bundled
stack. `DNSRebindingMiddleware` is a Starlette ASGI middleware that wraps
the SDK's `TransportSecurityMiddleware` and reinstates the `Host`/
`Origin` allowlist check. `main()` passes it to `server.run(...,
middleware=[…])`; Starlette appends user middleware *after* the auth
backend, so bearer-auth runs first and the Host check runs inside the
auth chain. Operators control the `Host` allowlist via
`PORTAINER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (default: localhost set); the `Origin`
allowlist is hardcoded to localhost since the only browser-hosted MCP
client in scope today is the local Inspector. `misconfig_warning()` runs
at startup and emits a WARNING when the bind host is non-loopback but
the host allowlist is still the default — turning the "I deployed it
and every request 421s" first-deploy moment into a self-diagnosing
error. The 421 response body is also rewritten to name
`PORTAINER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` so the operator sees the same pointer from
the client side.

### TLS posture — `tls.py`

Only relevant under HTTP. The server carries two secrets on the wire (the
gate token and each caller's permanent Portainer key), so plaintext is
never served on a non-loopback bind by accident. `resolve_posture(host)`
runs at startup and **refuses to boot** unless one posture is declared,
loud-failing (like the auth-token check) on any broken declaration — it
never silently downgrades. Operators pick one of three shapes, all
collapsing to a single runtime signal, `scheme == "https"`:

1. **Server-terminated TLS** — `PORTAINER_MCP_TLS_CERT`/`_TLS_KEY` are
   threaded into uvicorn's `ssl_certfile`/`ssl_keyfile` via the
   `uvicorn_config` dict, so the process speaks HTTPS directly. The server
   holds the cert, so it can `is_self_signed()`-check it and WARN (the only
   posture where it can inspect the cert).
2. **TLS-terminating proxy** — `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_TLS=1` (explicit
   attestation) plus `PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` make uvicorn trust
   the proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto`, which rewrites the scheme. The
   attestation is separate from `PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` (a functional knob)
   so a plaintext proxy can't silently satisfy the gate.
3. **Plaintext opt-out** — `PORTAINER_MCP_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_HTTP=1`
   is the one loud escape hatch; it WARNs every start and sets
   `auth.mark_insecure_transport()` so every audit record carries
   `insecure_transport: true`.

`TLSRequiredMiddleware` enforces `scheme == "https"` as a backstop (a
direct plaintext hit that bypasses a Tier-2 proxy still 426s). It is
installed via the verifier's `get_middleware()` — `PassthroughVerifier.
add_pre_auth_middleware()` stacks it *ahead* of the bearer-auth backend, so
a plaintext request is rejected before the per-user key is validated and
forwarded upstream (the `server.run(middleware=[…])` list runs *after*
auth, which is why DNS-rebinding sits there but the TLS check can't). The
loopback exemption is keyed on the **bind host** at install time, never on
the per-request client IP. There is no auto-self-signed mode: Node-based
MCP clients reject self-signed certs and none pin by fingerprint, so it
would be encrypted-but-unconnectable; a homelab operator mounts their own
(warned) instead.

### Per-request context — `request_context.py`

`snapshot()` returns `client_ip`, `user_agent`, and the MCP
`Mcp-Session-Id` for the in-flight HTTP request via
`fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_http_request()`. Both the audit log (in
the verifier) and the FastMCP request log call it. `passthrough.py` reads
the same live request for the per-user key (`key_from_request`) and for
cache-only identity enrichment (`identity_audit_fields`). Reading
directly from the live request avoids a subtle bug: MCP's
streamable-HTTP session manager dispatches every JSON-RPC message into a
long-lived task whose ContextVars were captured at session-creation
time, so an outer-`ContextVar` approach would log the stale
`initialize`-time values on every subsequent request. FastMCP's own
`RequestContextMiddleware` sits at position 0 of the middleware stack
(outside the auth backend), so `get_http_request()` is already populated
by the time `verify_token` executes.

### Logging — in `server.py`

`PORTAINER_MCP_LOG_FORMAT=text|json` (default `text`; the container image
overrides to `json`). The JSON formatter emits a single per-line envelope
and merges records whose `msg` parses as a JSON object into that
envelope, so audit and request records become first-class fields rather
than nested strings. Two structured emitters feed it:

- **Auth audit** — the verifier emits records on `portainer_mcp.audit`,
  carrying outcome + per-request context (`client_ip`, `user_agent`,
  `session_id`). `ok` fires only on a validation (cache miss), attributed with
  the validated Portainer identity (`portainer_user_id`, `portainer_username`);
  cache hits are silent. Failure outcomes fire per request.
- **Request log** — `_ContextualStructuredLogging`, a thin subclass of
  FastMCP's `StructuredLoggingMiddleware`, adds the same per-request
  context to the before/after/error records the middleware already
  emits, plus the validated Portainer identity (read from the validation
  cache, never the key) and, for a `tools/call`, the `tool` name (the
  bare `method` is only ever `tools/call`). The upstream `source` field is
  dropped entirely — it's a `Literal["client","server"]` that the request
  path always stamps `"client"`, so it carries no signal; identity is what
  distinguishes callers.

`_setup_logging()` also strips pre-existing handlers from `fastmcp`,
`httpx`, and `uvicorn.*` loggers and passes `uvicorn_config={"log_config":
None}` to `server.run()`, so a single formatter owns every record
regardless of which library installed handlers first.

### Response shaping — `shaping.py` and `redaction.py`

Three cooperating layers, applied to every tool the server exposes:

1. **`SelectArgTransform`** injects an optional `select` parameter on
   every tool. The caller passes a JMESPath expression; the server
   projects the response before returning it. This is how the model
   trims noisy Portainer payloads (snapshots, K8s `managedFields`, etc.)
   server-side instead of dragging them into context.

2. **`redact_envs`** walks the parsed response and rewrites env values to
   the sentinel `[REDACTED]` before `select` runs, so that a JMESPath
   expression like `select="Env[0].value"` lands on the sentinel rather
   than the real secret. The walker is field-name driven (`env` /
   `envvars`, case-insensitive) and dispatches on value shape — list of
   `{name, value}` dicts (Portainer `Env`/`EnvVars`, K8s `env`), or list
   of `"KEY=VAL"` strings (Docker-native). K8s `valueFrom` references
   are preserved — they're references to a Secret/ConfigMap, not the
   secret material itself. When redaction fires, the response carries a
   one-line summary `TextContent` naming `PORTAINER_EXPOSE_ENV_VALUES`
   so the caller knows how to disclose. Disabled with
   `PORTAINER_EXPOSE_ENV_VALUES=1`; the posture is logged at startup
   (`env value redaction: enabled` or `DISABLED (env values exposed)`).

3. **`ResponseCapMiddleware`** is the final safety valve. If a tool
   result exceeds `PORTAINER_MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS` (default 50 000), the
   middleware truncates and appends a hint that names `select` with a
   concrete example. The cap is sized to fire *before* Claude Code's
   own MCP output cap (~62k chars for dense JSON), so our hint reaches
   the model instead of Claude Code's generic "saved to file" message.

Redaction runs first on every JSON-shaped response (`select` and the
cap can't bypass it), `select` narrows next (cheaper bodies), and the
cap catches whatever still slips through. Both projection sites — the
wrapper around OpenAPI-generated tools (`_select_wrapper`) and the
proxy tools (`_apply_select`) — call `redact_envs` before applying the
JMESPath. Non-JSON proxy bodies (Docker logs / stats / error pages)
pass through unchanged: the walker is field-name driven and has
nothing to match.

`get_guidance` is exempt from the cap: it serves the full operating
guide, and `select` — the cap's escape hatch — is a no-op there, so a
truncated guide would be a dead end.

### Guidance gate — `guidance.py`

The full hygiene guide is too large for the MCP `instructions` field
(clients truncate it at ~2KB), so it's served by a `get_guidance` tool —
and delivered proactively by `GuidanceGateMiddleware`, a *toll booth*:
the first tool call from a caller whose idle window has lapsed is
answered with the guide itself plus a retry instruction (the tool is not
executed), and the caller is marked guided immediately. Delivery is the
proof, so nothing is correlated across requests and no lockout state
exists.

Callers are keyed on the authenticated principal — the SHA-256 digest of
the per-user `X-Portainer-API-Key` over HTTP, a process-wide sentinel
over stdio — and never on `Mcp-Session-Id`: clients and bridges mint a
fresh session id per request (SEP-2567), which is what permanently
locked out callers under the old session-keyed gate (#75). The window
slides with activity (`PORTAINER_MCP_GUIDANCE_TTL`, default 1800s), so
re-delivery lands on the next conversation, not mid-task.
`PORTAINER_MCP_DISABLE_GUIDANCE_GATE=1` disables enforcement.

Middleware order is load-bearing: the gate sits *inside* the structured
request log (a bounced attempt is still recorded — it also emits its own
`guidance_bounce` record, since the request log shows the call as a
normal success) but *outside* `ResponseCapMiddleware` (the bounce
carries the full guide and must never be truncated).

## Why this shape

- **OpenAPI-driven, not hand-coded.** Portainer ships a spec; let
  FastMCP generate the tools so spec bumps are mostly a regen.
- **Filter at the spec layer.** Profiles reduce the visible surface
  without touching individual tools.
- **Universal shaping.** `select`, redaction, and the cap apply to
  every tool — generated and hand-written alike — so the model learns
  one pattern that works everywhere.
- **Safe-by-default disclosure.** Env values in JSON responses are
  redacted on the server before they reach the model, instead of
  relying on the model to ask the right `select`. The toggle is global
  and operator-controlled, so exposure is an explicit decision rather
  than a per-tool oversight.
