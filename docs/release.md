# Releasing

The release workflow at
[`../.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml) builds
the wheel and publishes to PyPI on every tag push matching `X.Y.Z`. Auth is
OIDC via PyPI Trusted Publishing — no API tokens or repo secrets.

## One-time setup

A Pending Publisher must exist on PyPI **and** TestPyPI. Do once per
distribution name:

- **pypi.org → Account → Publishing → Add pending publisher**
  - Repository: `portainer/portainer-mcp`
  - Workflow: `release.yml`
  - Environment: leave blank (any)
- **test.pypi.org → Account → Publishing → Add pending publisher**
  - Repository: `portainer/portainer-mcp`
  - Workflow: `release-test.yml`
  - Environment: leave blank (any)

No GitHub secrets, no environments, no token rotation. If you ever rename the
distribution, register new Pending Publishers under the new name.

### Fork release notes (whitehara/portainer-mcp)

This fork does **not** publish to PyPI or Docker Hub — the `release.yml` /
`release-test.yml` workflows referenced above, and the Docker Hub section that
used to live here, don't apply. The only release artifact is the container
image, published to GHCR by
[`release-docker.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-docker.yml) via
`GITHUB_TOKEN` (no separate registry credentials needed).

**Tag convention**: `hl-<upstream-version>-<fork-rev>` (e.g. `hl-2.44.0-1`),
never bare `X.Y.Z` — this fork tracks `upstream/main`
(`https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp`) and upstream also tags releases
as bare `X.Y.Z`, so a fork tag in the same namespace would collide with (or
even overwrite) an upstream tag pointing at a different commit. `<fork-rev>`
increments per fork-only release against the same upstream version.

**`pyproject.toml`'s `version` field always mirrors the upstream version it
was merged from — this fork never edits it independently.** Bump it only as
part of merging a newer `upstream/main` (see the `upstream-sync` skill), never
to cut a fork-only release; fork-only changes get a new `<fork-rev>` instead.

Image tags emitted per push of `hl-<upstream-version>-<fork-rev>`:
`:<upstream-version>-<fork-rev>` (e.g. `:2.44.0-1`, pins the exact fork
build), `:<upstream-version>` (e.g. `:2.44.0`, floats to the latest fork
revision for that upstream version), and `:latest`.

**Syncing with upstream** (merging in `upstream/main`, reconciling this fork's
patches, re-tagging) is a separate procedure from cutting a release — see the
`upstream-sync` skill (`.claude/skills/upstream-sync/SKILL.md`) and
`.claude/FORK-DELTA.md` for the current list of fork-specific patches that
have to survive each sync. A weekly `upstream-drift` GitHub Actions workflow
opens an issue when this fork falls behind.

### GitHub Release (`.mcpb` bundles)

[`release-mcpb.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-mcpb.yml) builds the Claude
Desktop one-click bundles on the same `X.Y.Z` tag trigger and attaches them to
the **GitHub Release** for the tag (creating the Release if it doesn't exist
yet — PyPI and Docker Hub don't need one, so this workflow owns it).

It's a runner matrix, not multi-arch-in-one-job: PyInstaller freezes the
running interpreter and can't cross-compile, so each platform builds natively.
Current targets:

- `darwin-arm64` (macOS, `macos-14`) — Apple Silicon only for now.
- `win32-x64` (`windows-latest`)
- `linux-x64` (`ubuntu-latest`)

Each leg runs the same `tag == pyproject.version` gate and `pytest` as the PyPI
workflow, then calls [`packaging/mcpb/build.sh`](../packaging/mcpb/build.sh),
which freezes the binary (the `mcpb` dependency group pins PyInstaller), stamps
the tag into `manifest.json` (the committed file carries a `0.0.0`
placeholder — nothing to hand-bump at release), and packs
`portainer-mcp-X.Y.Z-<target>.mcpb`. No repo secrets: it uses the built-in
`GITHUB_TOKEN` with `contents: write`.

The workflow is deliberately off the PyPI/Docker critical path — a PyInstaller
failure on one platform won't block the wheel publish.

**The bundles are unsigned.** macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen flag
downloaded unsigned binaries, so the install isn't yet one-click from a
download — the workaround is in
[`distribution/claude-desktop.md`](distribution/claude-desktop.md). Code
signing (Apple Developer ID notarization + Windows Authenticode) and a single
universal `.mcpb` are tracked follow-ups, not in this workflow.

To iterate locally, run `packaging/mcpb/build.sh <target> <version>` on a
machine of that platform (it can't cross-build).

## Dry run on TestPyPI

Before tagging a real release, do a dry run against TestPyPI to confirm the
build and OIDC publish path work end-to-end:

1. Bump `version` in [`../pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml) and commit.
2. **GitHub → Actions → Release (TestPyPI) → Run workflow** on the branch
   carrying the bump.
3. The workflow ([`release-test.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-test.yml))
   runs tests, builds, and publishes to TestPyPI.
4. Verify at `https://test.pypi.org/project/mcp-portainer/X.Y.Z/`.

TestPyPI doesn't allow re-uploading the same version (separate from PyPI's
copy of the rule). If the dry run finds a problem, fix it and bump to
`X.Y.Z.post1` for the next TestPyPI attempt — PyPI itself stays free to
receive plain `X.Y.Z`.

## Cutting a release

1. Decide the version per [`versioning.md`](versioning.md).
2. Bump `version` in [`../pyproject.toml`](../pyproject.toml).
3. `uv lock` to refresh [`../uv.lock`](../uv.lock).
4. Move the `[Unreleased]` block in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) under
   a new `[X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading; leave a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`
   block on top.
5. Bump the `Skill version:` footer in
   [`../skills/portainer-mcp-hygiene/SKILL.md`](../skills/portainer-mcp-hygiene/SKILL.md)
   to the new `X.Y.Z`. (The guide is bundled and served via `get_guidance`, so
   there are no manual-install snippets to re-pin.)
6. Commit: `Release X.Y.Z`.
7. Tag and push:
   ```bash
   git tag X.Y.Z
   git push origin X.Y.Z
   ```
8. The workflow verifies the tag matches `pyproject.version`, runs tests,
   builds, and publishes.
9. Once green, the new version is live at
   `https://pypi.org/project/mcp-portainer/X.Y.Z/`.

## Recovery

- **Tag/version mismatch:** workflow fails fast. Delete the tag locally and
  remotely (`git tag -d X.Y.Z && git push --delete origin X.Y.Z`), fix the
  version, retag.
- **PyPI rejects upload (version exists):** PyPI doesn't allow re-uploading
  the same version, even after a yank. Bump the patch and retag.
- **Trusted Publishing OIDC failure:** the Pending Publisher's repo /
  workflow values must match exactly (case-sensitive).
