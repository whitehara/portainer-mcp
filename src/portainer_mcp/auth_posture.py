"""Auth posture resolution for the HTTP transport.

Exactly one of two auth postures must be declared, mirroring the TLS posture
pattern (`tls.resolve_posture`): the server never boots with an ambiguous or
absent auth boundary.

  - gate token (default): `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` — a shared bearer in
    `Authorization` admits the request (`auth.PassthroughVerifier`).
  - trust-proxy auth: `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_AUTH=1` — an identity-aware
    proxy in front (e.g. Pomerium in MCP server mode) performs the MCP OAuth
    flow and *owns* the `Authorization` header, so a static gate token cannot
    survive the hop (issue #76). The gate compare is replaced by per-request
    proof that the request transited the proxy.

That proof takes one of two shapes, because uvicorn's proxy-header handling
rewrites `scope["client"]` from `X-Forwarded-For` for connections arriving
from `PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS` — so "check the socket peer" and
"trust the proxy's forwarded headers" are mutually exclusive signals:

  - inherited (TLS-terminating proxy, the common shape): requires
    `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_TLS=1` + `PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`.
    The attestation is the request scheme: uvicorn sets `https` only from a
    trusted peer's `X-Forwarded-Proto`, and this shape holds no cert, so no
    direct connection can present `https`. The allowlist is inherited — no
    extra variable to configure.
  - socket peer (server-terminated TLS, the end-to-end-encrypted shape):
    `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_AUTH_IPS=<ip/cidr,...>` names the proxy
    directly and uvicorn's proxy-header rewrite is disabled so
    `scope["client"]` stays the raw transport peer.

Whichever shape, a wildcard peer allowlist (`*` or a zero-prefix network
like `0.0.0.0/0`) is a startup error — it would admit any host that can
reach the bind address — and the inherited shape refuses a server-held TLS
cert (it would let every direct connection present `https` and void the
attestation). The per-user `X-Portainer-API-Key` validation floor is
untouched: trust-proxy auth drops the gate, never authentication.
