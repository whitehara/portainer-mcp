"""Universal response shaping for every tool the server exposes.

Two cooperating layers:

1. `ResponseCapMiddleware` — caps every tool result's text content at
   `max_chars`. The final safety valve.

2. `SelectArgTransform` — wraps every tool with an optional JMESPath
   `select` parameter, so the model can project noisy Portainer
   responses server-side. Tools that already declare `select` are passed
   through unchanged.

`select` narrows first (cheaper bodies); the cap catches whatever slips
through (model omitted `select`, or the post-projection body is still
genuinely big).
