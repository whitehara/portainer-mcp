"""Apply spec-defect mitigations to a Portainer OpenAPI spec.

Drops operations that shouldn't reach the tool surface (deprecated
duplicates, edge-agent-only callbacks), drops `/websocket/*` paths (protocol
upgrades, not REST), strips malformed `enum` blocks that defeat naive
generators, and injects real properties into undocumented bare-object
request-body schemas that would otherwise collapse into a single opaque
tool parameter FastMCP mis-serializes.

Also normalises stray tab characters in scalar text — swaggo occasionally
emits a literal tab inside a description string. Current specs keep them
inside block scalars, where YAML tolerates them, so this is hygiene for the
generated tool descriptions plus insurance against one landing in an
indentation position, where it *would* be a parse error.

# `UpdateKubernetesNamespaceDeprecated` (PUT /kubernetes/{id}/namespaces) is
# upstream's superseded twin of `UpdateKubernetesNamespace`
# (PUT /kubernetes/{id}/namespaces/{namespace}); it takes the target namespace
# from the body instead of the path. Dropping it keeps the namespace-update
# surface unambiguous for the model. Through 2.42 it was *also* structurally
# broken — it declared a required `namespace` path param absent from its own
# template — but upstream fixed that in 2.43, so this is now a deliberate
# policy exclusion, not a defect workaround. New defects get added here.

# can never succeed for an MCP caller. 2.43 gave them a dedicated `edge_agent`
# tag — before that they were mis-tagged `endpoints` and leaked into the DOCKER
# profile, and we matched four of them by (method, path). Now we drop every op
# carrying the tag: it catches all of them (not an arbitrary subset), and one
# (`EndpointEdgeStackInspect`) also carries `edge_stacks`, so it would otherwise

# inside the database (bucket=endpoints, key=0)` whatever the stack's age
# (portainer-mcp #106; CE and EE handlers match as of 2.45.0). The web UI
# always sends it, which is how it survived. Marking it required makes FastMCP
# enforce the tool argument instead of relying on the model to read prose.

# `policies.policyCreatePayload` and `policies.policyConflictsPayload` — the
# request-body schemas for `PolicyCreate` (POST /policies) and
# `PolicyConflicts` (POST /policies/conflicts) — are undocumented upstream:
# swaggo emits a bare `{"type": "object"}` with no declared properties. With
# nothing to flatten, FastMCP falls back to a single opaque `body` tool
# parameter for the whole payload, but then serializes the call *wrapped*
# under that parameter's own name (`{"body": {...}}`) instead of using its
# value as the literal request body — Portainer never sees the real fields,
# so every call fails with a generic 400 ("Policy name is required and
# cannot be empty" / "Policy type must be one of the valid types") no
# matter what's supplied. `PolicyUpdate`'s payload schema *does* declare
# real properties, so it flattens (and works) correctly — this defect is
# specific to the two bare-object schemas. Field shapes confirmed by hand
# against a live 2.45.0 server: Create mirrors `policyUpdatePayload`'s
# fields; Conflicts uses the server's actual lowercase JSON tags
# (`policyId`, `type`, `environmentGroups`) — capitalised names would still
# decode (Go's `encoding/json` matches case-insensitively) but would
# advertise names the API doesn't use. `policyId` lets a conflict check
# exclude the policy being edited from its own results (the update-preview
# case); omitting it would silently limit the tool to create-preview only.
#
# `Type` is built by `_policy_type_property` as a plain `type: string` +
# `enum` — never `allOf: [$ref policies.PolicyType]`. That shape is exactly
# what `ENUM_STRIPS` exists to unwind (an inner enum on the referenced
# schema contradicting an outer one), and it would only *appear* to work
# here because `ENUM_STRIPS` happens to run first in `patch()` and empties
# `policies.PolicyType`'s enum before this runs — nothing pins that
# ordering. The enum values are read from `policies.PolicyType`'s own enum
# in `patch()` before `ENUM_STRIPS` empties it (deduplicated, since that's
# the very defect `ENUM_STRIPS` targets), not hand-copied, so they can't
# silently drift the way `policyUpdatePayload`'s own local enum already
# has — it's missing three policy types added in 2.43/2.44
# (`cleanup-docker`, `network-security-k8s`, `pod-security-standards-k8s`).
# That's upstream's pre-existing omission on a schema this project doesn't
# patch (`PolicyUpdate` isn't part of this defect), not fixed here.
