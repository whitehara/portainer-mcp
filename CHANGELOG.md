# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The versioning policy is described in [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md)
— major+minor tracks the Portainer API version; the patch slot belongs to
the MCP server.

## [Unreleased]

## [2.45.1] — 2026-09-02

Targets Portainer 2.45.x.

### Changed

- **cryptography bumped 48.0.1 → 50.0.0** (Dependabot, #96). Direct
  production dependency; no behaviour change on our side.

### Fixed

- **`endpointId` is now a required argument on `StackGitRedeploy`,
  `StackUpdateGit` and `StackMigrate`.** Upstream documents it as an
  optional fallback for stacks created before Portainer 1.18, but the
  handlers apply a missing value as environment 0, so every call without it
  failed with `Object not found inside the database (bucket=endpoints,
  key=0)` regardless of the stack's age. The patched spec marks it required
  so the argument is enforced at the tool boundary. (#106)
- **Write tools with all-optional body fields send `{}` instead of no
  body.** FastMCP sends no request body when the model supplies no body
  fields, and Portainer rejects that with `400 Invalid request payload:
  EOF`, so a bare `StackGitRedeploy` ("pull and re-apply as configured")
  could never succeed without a decoy field. Routes that declare an
  `application/json` body now go out as an empty object, and the hygiene
  guide's `Prune: false` workaround is gone. (#106)
- **Proxy tools accept a JSON object `body` and default `Content-Type` to
  `application/json`.** `docker_proxy` / `kubernetes_proxy` declared `body`
  as string-only, so a model sending the payload as an object was rejected
  and typically retried by stringifying it again — which Docker then refused
  with `cannot unmarshal string into Go value`. A body sent without a
  `Content-Type` was also refused by Docker (`malformed Content-Type header
  (): mime: no media type`), so any JSON POST needed an explicit header to
  work at all. Objects and arrays are now serialized server-side, strings are
  still forwarded verbatim, an explicit `Content-Type` is always preserved,
  and a body that is a JSON string containing JSON (encoded twice) is
  rejected at the tool boundary with an `encoded twice` hint instead of
  reaching the daemon. (#105)
- **Container healthcheck follows `PORTAINER_MCP_HTTP_PORT` and
  `PORTAINER_MCP_HTTP_HOST`** — the image always probed `127.0.0.1:17717`, so
  overriding the port marked a healthy server unhealthy, and under
  `--network host` could report whatever else sat on 17717 as healthy. The
  probe now resolves both variables with the server's own fallback semantics
  (an empty value behaves like an unset one), and maps a wildcard bind to its
  loopback. (#98; approach from #99 by @paulcakeface)

## [2.45.0] — 2026-08-27

Targets Portainer 2.45.x.

### Changed

- **Embedded spec bumped to Portainer EE 2.45.0** (was 2.44.0). Total
  operations 428 → 466. `kubernetes` grows 95 → 119 — the largest delta by
  far, and the only one landing in the default profile; the orphan tags
  `addons` (5 → 17) and `omni` (13 → 14) account for most of the rest.
  Default `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES,GITOPS` coverage moves 211 → 236 and the
  six-profile union 350 → 375. Upstream added and removed no tags this
  minor, so [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md)'s orphan table needed
  only the two recounts. Re-audited every spec-defect mitigation against
  the new spec: all six (the `UpdateKubernetesNamespaceDeprecated`
  exclusion, the `edge_agent` tag drop, the `/websocket` path drop, the
  `policies.PolicyType` and `images.Status` duplicate-enum strips, and the
  `portaineree.ConditionOperator` bare-`=` value-tag workaround) are still
  load-bearing and unchanged — none of the underlying upstream defects were
  fixed in 2.45.

- **Re-audited the spec-defect mitigations against upstream 2.44.0** — a step
  the 2.44.0 release skipped. (This landed mid-cycle, before the spec bump
  above; its operation counts refer to 2.44.0.) Upstream fixes its defects
  silently, so nothing failed when the workarounds went stale. Two of the three
  `EXCLUDED_OPERATION_IDS` entries (`providerInfo`, `provisionCluster`) were
  dead code: their quoted-enum defect was fixed in 2.43 and the operations
  were deleted outright in 2.44. `UpdateKubernetesNamespaceDeprecated` had its
  structural defect (a required `namespace` path param absent from its own
  template) fixed in 2.43 too, so it stays excluded as a deliberate policy
  call — it's upstream's superseded twin of `UpdateKubernetesNamespace` — and
  the comment now says so. `ENUM_STRIPS` loses a nested-trail walk that only
  ever traversed one level. Still load-bearing on 2.44 and unchanged: the
  `tag:yaml.org,2002:value` constructor (`portaineree.ConditionOperator` ships
  a bare `=`; a pristine `SafeLoader` raises on it), the `policies.PolicyType`
  enum strip, and the `/websocket` + `edge_agent` drops. Verified by
  regenerating the spec: byte-identical output, so no tool-surface change.

### Fixed

- **`images.Status` duplicate enum stripped** for consistency with
  `policies.PolicyType` — the same upstream swaggo defect (the varname list is
  emitted twice, leaving 12 values with 6 duplicated). It reaches only the
  output schemas of `ServiceImageStatus`, `containerImageStatus` and
  `stackImagesStatus`, so the effect is cosmetic; it left the then-current
  operation count unchanged at 428.
- **`PolicyCreate` and `PolicyConflicts` were completely broken** — their
  request-body schemas (`policies.policyCreatePayload`,
  `policies.policyConflictsPayload`) are undocumented upstream (a bare
  `{"type": "object"}` with no properties), so FastMCP had nothing to
  flatten and fell back to a single opaque `body` parameter — then
  serialized the call *wrapped* under that parameter's own name
  (`{"body": {...}}`) instead of using it as the literal request body.
  Portainer never saw the real fields, so every call failed with a generic
  400 regardless of what was supplied. Fixed by injecting the real property
  shapes (confirmed by hand against a live server) into both schemas —
  `PolicyCreate` mirrors `PolicyUpdate`'s fields, `PolicyConflicts` uses
  the server's actual lowercase JSON tags (`policyId`, `type`,
  `environmentGroups`) rather than the capitalised names that happen to
  decode anyway. Both `Type`/`type` enums are read from
  `policies.PolicyType`'s own enum at patch time rather than hand-copied,
  so they can't silently drift out of sync with the real catalog the way
  `PolicyUpdate`'s own local enum already has (missing `cleanup-docker`,
  `network-security-k8s`, `pod-security-standards-k8s` — upstream's
  pre-existing omission, not fixed here). `PolicyUpdate` itself was never
  affected by the original defect — its schema already declared real
  properties.

## [2.44.0] — 2026-07-30

Targets Portainer 2.44.x.

### Changed

- **Embedded spec bumped to Portainer EE 2.44.0** (was 2.43.0). Total
  operations 412 → 428. Default `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES,GITOPS` coverage
  moves 205 → 211 and the six-profile union 344 → 350. New `addons` tag
  (5 ops, cluster addon management) added to the orphan list in
  [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md). `kaas` shrinks 4 → 1 op as three
  cloud-provisioning endpoints (`/cloud/amazon/provision`,
  `/cloud/azure/provision`, `/cloud/gke/provision`) were removed upstream;
  `cloud_credentials` grows 6 → 11 and `observability` grows 15 → 18.

### Security

- **Dependency bumps clearing all open Dependabot alerts** (15 alerts, 8
  packages, lockfile-only — no constraint changes): mcp 1.27.1 → 1.28.1
  (session-to-principal binding, Host/Origin validation on the WebSocket
  transport, task-handler isolation), starlette 1.2.0 → 1.3.1 (urlencoded
  form-limit DoS, hostname poisoning), cryptography 48.0.0 → 48.0.1
  (patched OpenSSL in wheels), python-multipart 0.0.29 → 0.0.31
  (querystring-parsing DoS, parameter smuggling), pyjwt 2.12.1 → 2.13.0
  (JWK-as-HMAC-secret confusion), joserfc 1.6.5 → 1.6.8 (empty HMAC key
  accepted, payload-size-limit bypass), pydantic-settings 2.14.1 → 2.14.2
  (secrets_dir symlink traversal), setuptools 82.0.1 → 83.0.0 (MANIFEST.in
  exclusion bypass). Combines Dependabot PRs #83–#90 into one lockfile
  update; the mcp SDK's new session binding is behaviourally inert here
  (the verifiers report a constant principal), and its WebSocket /
  experimental-tasks deprecations touch nothing this server uses.

## [2.43.3] — 2026-07-23

Targets Portainer 2.43.x.

### Added

- **Configurable upstream timeout** (`PORTAINER_TIMEOUT`, seconds) —
  [#80](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/issues/80). The upstream
  Portainer HTTP timeout was hardcoded at 30s, routinely too short for
  stack creation (Portainer deploys synchronously — the request holds open
  through image pull and compose up). The default rises to **120s**, the
  connect phase stays capped at 10s so an unreachable Portainer still
  fails fast, and the knob applies to both transports. Non-numeric or
  non-positive values refuse to boot; the resolved posture is logged at
  startup.

### Changed

- **Post-send timeouts now say the write may have succeeded** (#80). A
  request that times out after reaching Portainer is ambiguous, not failed
  — Portainer keeps processing, which is how two timed-out stack creates
  left two stack records behind in #80. FastMCP's stock error ("please
  retry") invites exactly the duplicate-creating reflex, so
  `ReadTimeout`/`WriteTimeout` errors are rewritten to name the ambiguity,
  instruct the model to verify current state (e.g. `StackList`) before
  retrying, and point at `PORTAINER_TIMEOUT`. Connect-phase timeouts are
  left untouched — the request never reached Portainer.

## [2.43.2] — 2026-07-22

Targets Portainer 2.43.x.

### Fixed

- **Guidance gate no longer keys on `Mcp-Session-Id` — clients behind
  session-churning bridges are never locked out** (#75). The gate is now a
  *toll booth*: the first tool call from a caller whose idle window has
  lapsed is answered with the operating guide itself (plus a retry
  instruction) instead of a "call `get_guidance` and retry" bounce, and the
  caller is marked guided immediately — delivery is the proof, so nothing
  needs to be correlated across requests and there is no lockout state.
  Callers are identified by the authenticated principal (the per-user
  API-key digest over HTTP, the process over stdio), the scoping SEP-2567
  recommends now that major clients mint a fresh session id per tool call.
  The window slides with activity (`PORTAINER_MCP_GUIDANCE_TTL`, default
  1800s), so re-delivery happens on the next conversation, not mid-task —
  including over stdio, where the old gate fired only once per process
  lifetime. `PORTAINER_MCP_DISABLE_GUIDANCE_GATE=1` disables enforcement
  entirely (install the hygiene skill manually on clients in that case);
  `get_guidance` remains available on demand.

### Added

- **Trust-proxy auth posture** (`PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_AUTH=1`) for
  deployments behind an identity-aware proxy that owns the `Authorization`
  header (e.g. Pomerium in MCP server mode) —
  [#76](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/issues/76). The gate-token
  compare is replaced by per-request proxy attestation: inherited from the
  `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_TLS` + `PORTAINER_MCP_FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`
  declaration behind a TLS-terminating proxy, or an explicit
  `PORTAINER_MCP_TRUSTED_PROXY_AUTH_IPS` socket-peer allowlist when the
  server terminates TLS itself. Exactly one auth posture must be declared
  (gate token XOR trust-proxy); every degenerate combination — both, neither,
  trust + plaintext opt-out, wildcard allowlists (`*` or zero-prefix CIDRs),
  a server-held cert alongside the inherited shape, a peer allowlist without
  the trust flag — refuses to boot, and the
  per-user `X-Portainer-API-Key` validation floor is unchanged. New audit
  outcomes `untrusted_scheme` / `untrusted_peer`; audit records under this
  posture carry `auth_posture: "trust_proxy"`.

## [2.43.1] — 2026-07-02

Targets Portainer 2.43.x.

### Added

- **New `GITOPS` profile** bundling the `gitops` tag (register/list/test git
  sources, browse refs — the GitOps *source* management surface).
- **JMESPath errors now diagnose double-escaped quotes.** When a `select`
  expression fails to parse and contains literal `\"` (the JSON-in-JSON
  double-escaping models fall into), the error names the cause and suggests
  plain double quotes or a `contains(...)` filter instead of the lexer's
  opaque `Unknown token \`.
- **Hygiene guide: four field-tested additions** from agent usage reports —
  the backslash-escaping trap and its `contains()` workaround; the
  `400 … EOF` rejection when a write call sends zero body fields (e.g. a
  bare `StackGitRedeploy` — pass `Prune: false`); verifying a K8s deploy
  end-to-end via the service-proxy path; and which `StackCreateKubernetesGit`
  fields are the blessed path (`SourceID`) vs the still-functional deprecated
  inline `Repository*` fields.

### Changed

- **`gitops` is now in the default profile set.** Since Portainer 2.43 a
  registered GitOps source is required to deploy a git-backed stack, so
  `gitops` now rides along inside both `DOCKER` and `KUBERNETES` (next to
  `stacks`) and the default `PORTAINER_PROFILES` becomes
  `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES,GITOPS`. Without it, git-based stack deploys fail
  for lack of a source. `gitops` is removed from the orphan-tag inventory in
  [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md).

## [2.43.0] — 2026-06-29

Targets Portainer 2.43.x.

### Changed

- **Embedded spec bumped to Portainer EE 2.43.0** (was 2.42.0). Total
  operations 409 → 412. Default `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES` coverage moves
  193 → 190 and the five-profile union 334 → 329: upstream resolved a
  long-standing tagging defect by moving the Edge-agent callbacks
  (heartbeat/status, async poll, alert + chart status, edge stack/job sync)
  off the `endpoints` tag onto a new dedicated `edge_agent` tag, so they no
  longer leak into the DOCKER profile as tools that can never succeed for a
  non-agent caller. New `allowlist` tag (2 ops, URL allow list) added to the
  orphan list in [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md).
- **Edge-agent callback exclusion is now tag-based.** `spec/patch_spec.py`
  drops every operation carrying the new `edge_agent` tag (eight callbacks
  that 403 for any caller without `X-PortainerAgent-EdgeID`), replacing the
  previous four-op `(method, path)` matcher — possible because 2.43.0 also
  gave 15 of 16 previously-unnamed operations an `operationId` (webhooks,
  endpoint-group create, docker browse-put, edge key generate, the edge
  callbacks, and the websocket ops).

## [2.42.6] — 2026-06-18

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Added

- **Claude Desktop one-click `.mcpb` bundles.** The server now ships as a
  self-contained PyInstaller binary bundle (no Python/uv/Node needed on the
  client), built per-platform (`darwin-arm64`, `win32-x64`, `linux-x64`) on
  tag push and attached to the GitHub Release. See
  [#72](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pull/72). Bundles are
  unsigned for now — Gatekeeper/SmartScreen workaround is documented in
  [`docs/distribution/claude-desktop.md`](docs/distribution/claude-desktop.md).
- **Bundled hygiene guidance, served on demand via a `get_guidance` tool.**
  The full `portainer-mcp-hygiene` skill now ships with every install method
  (uvx, container, `.mcpb`) sourced from the same `SKILL.md`, so it can't
  drift. A `GuidanceGateMiddleware` requires `get_guidance` once per session
  (transport-aware session scoping) so the guide reliably lands in context
  rather than relying on the truncatable `instructions` field. A missing
  guide is now a hard startup failure, matching the loud-fail-on-misconfig
  convention.

### Changed

- **Hygiene skill guidance expanded** to cover mutations and typed Kubernetes
  field shapes, and to report its own gaps (failing `select` examples,
  redaction/truncation mismatches, missing tools) as scrubbed,
  consent-gated issues against `portainer/portainer-mcp`. See
  [#71](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pull/71).

### Removed

- **Manual hygiene-skill curl install instructions** (README,
  `docs/distribution/claude-desktop.md`). The guide is now bundled and served
  via `get_guidance`, so the curl-install snippets were redundant and
  drift-prone.

## [2.42.5] — 2026-06-09

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (HTTP transport): the HTTP credential model is now per-user
  passthrough.** Previously the HTTP bearer token gated access while a single
  shared `PORTAINER_API_KEY` was the upstream Portainer credential for every
  caller. Now the bearer token is only a gate, and each caller must supply
  **their own** Portainer API key in the `X-Portainer-API-Key` header; it is
  validated against `/users/me` and injected upstream per-request. **Setting
  `PORTAINER_API_KEY` under `PORTAINER_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` now hard-fails at
  startup** — it is a stdio-only credential. Migration: drop `PORTAINER_API_KEY`
  from your HTTP deployment and have each client send `X-Portainer-API-Key`
  alongside the existing `Authorization: Bearer` gate token. Stdio transport is
  unchanged. Validation is cached positive-only (TTL
  `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_CACHE_TTL`, default 60s); audit records gain
  `no_user_key` / `invalid_user_key` outcomes and the `tool` name, and the
  per-user key is never logged. See [#66](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pull/66).
- **Bumped `fastmcp` to `>=3.4.2` and dropped the direct `starlette` pin.** The
  CVE-2026-48710 floor is now carried transitively by the newer fastmcp, so the
  explicit starlette pin added in 2.42.3 is no longer needed.

### Added

- **TLS posture enforcement on non-loopback HTTP binds.** The server refuses to
  boot on a non-loopback bind unless the operator declares one of three shapes:
  a server-terminated cert (`PORTAINER_MCP_TLS_CERT` / `_TLS_KEY`), proxy TLS
  attestation (`PORTAINER_MCP_TRUST_PROXY_TLS=1` + `..._FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS`),
  or the loud plaintext opt-out
  (`PORTAINER_MCP_DANGEROUSLY_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT_HTTP=1`, which marks every audit
  record `insecure_transport: true`). Loopback binds are exempt for dev. A
  `TLSRequiredMiddleware` backstop runs *before* auth, so a plaintext request is
  rejected before any per-user key is validated or forwarded upstream.
  Self-signed certs WARN, never block. See [#67](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pull/67).

### Documentation

- Clarified in the `portainer-mcp-hygiene` skill that an edge agent's health
  comes from its heartbeat, not its `Status` field. See
  [#70](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/pull/70).

## [2.42.4] — 2026-06-02

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Changed

- **Container images are now multi-arch (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`).**
  The Docker Hub release workflow adds a QEMU setup step and builds both
  platforms into a single manifest list under the existing `:X.Y.Z` / `:X.Y`
  tags.

## [2.42.3] — 2026-05-29

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Security

- **Pinned `starlette>=1.0.1` to close CVE-2026-48710 (BadHost).**
  Starlette is transitive via `fastmcp`→`mcp` with no upstream floor at the
  fixed version; the pin is asserted directly so a re-lock can't drift back to
  a vulnerable release. Resolves to 1.2.0.

### Fixed

- **Proxy `query_params` / `headers` tolerate how different MCP clients
  serialize object arguments.** Some clients (notably Claude Desktop) send the
  whole object as a JSON string, which pydantic rejected before the tool ran —
  blocking every Docker/Kubernetes endpoint that needs a query string (logs,
  `all=true`, label/field selectors, stats). A `BeforeValidator` now parses a
  JSON-string argument back into an object and normalizes each value to its
  wire form, so native bools/numbers and nested `filters` objects work too. The
  tool schema is unchanged, so the model still sees one canonical contract.
- **Proxy tools surface upstream HTTP failures as errors.** `docker_proxy` /
  `kubernetes_proxy` previously returned a 4xx/5xx body as a normal result, so
  a failed call (e.g. a wrong `environment_id` 404) could be silently nulled
  out by a `select` projection and look like empty data. They now raise a tool
  error carrying the status and the (truncated) upstream body, so the model can
  tell a failed request from a missing field.

## [2.42.2] — 2026-05-28

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Added

- **Env value redaction on every response.** Stack, container, and
  Kubernetes env values are rewritten to `[REDACTED]` before leaving the
  MCP tool boundary so secrets don't leak into the model's context just
  because a tool happened to include them. The redaction runs *before*
  JMESPath `select`, so a projection like `select="Env[0].value"` lands
  on the sentinel. The response carries a one-line summary naming the
  toggle. Set `PORTAINER_EXPOSE_ENV_VALUES=1` to disclose; the posture
  is logged at startup. Covers Portainer `Env`/`EnvVars` pairs, Docker
  `"KEY=VAL"` strings, and Kubernetes `env[].value`; K8s `valueFrom`
  references are preserved.
  See [#61](https://github.com/portainer/portainer-mcp/issues/61).
- **`readOnlyHint` tool annotation.** Every generated tool now carries the
  MCP `readOnlyHint` annotation so clients can relax approval prompts for
  non-mutating calls. Spec-derived tools derive it from the HTTP method
  (`GET`/`HEAD` are read-only, everything else a write — setting it `False`
  also activates the spec's `destructiveHint` default); `docker_proxy` /
  `kubernetes_proxy` track `PORTAINER_READ_ONLY`, honest because the proxy
  hard-rejects non-`GET` in read-only mode. The hint is a client-side UX
  signal, not enforcement — the read-only guarantee remains the `GET`/`HEAD`
  route filter and the proxy's method check.

### Changed

- Proxy responses (`docker_proxy`, `kubernetes_proxy`) are now re-serialised
  through `json.dumps` whenever they're JSON and the redaction posture is
  active (i.e. by default). Output is byte-identical for the model but no
  longer preserves upstream whitespace or key ordering. Non-JSON bodies
  (logs, stats, error pages) still pass through verbatim.

## [2.42.1] — 2026-05-26

Targets Portainer 2.42.x. First build to ship a container image alongside
the PyPI wheel, and the first release with a bearer-gated HTTP transport.

### Added

- **Container image** at `docker.io/portainer/portainer-mcp`, published
  on every `X.Y.Z` tag push from
  [`.github/workflows/release-docker.yml`](.github/workflows/release-docker.yml).
  Tagged `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y` per release; no `latest`. See
  [`docs/docker.md`](docs/docker.md).
- **HTTP bearer auth.** New `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` env, **required**
  when `PORTAINER_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` and ignored for stdio. Strict
  validation at startup (min 32 chars, ASCII printable, no whitespace —
  loud-fail on any defect); constant-time comparison via
  `hmac.compare_digest`; masked fingerprint in the startup log, full
  value never logged. Wired through FastMCP's `TokenVerifier` protocol —
  FastMCP renders the 401 + `WWW-Authenticate` response on failure.
- **DNS-rebinding allowlist** for the HTTP transport.
  `PORTAINER_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (default `127.0.0.1:*,localhost:*,[::1]:*`)
  validates the `Host` header on every request; mismatches return 421
  with a body that names the env var. The `Origin` allowlist is hardcoded
  to localhost — programmatic MCP clients omit `Origin` and pass through.
  A startup WARNING fires when the bind host is non-loopback while the
  allowlist is still the localhost defaults, so the
  "deployed-then-it-421s" case self-diagnoses.
- **Auth audit log.** Every HTTP auth attempt emits a structured record
  under the `portainer_mcp.audit` sub-logger with `outcome`, `client_ip`,
  `user_agent`, and the MCP `session_id` — joinable against the
  FastMCP-layer `request_start` / `request_success` records by
  `session_id`. The attempted token is never written.
- **Selectable log shape.** `PORTAINER_MCP_LOG_FORMAT=text|json`
  (default `text`; container image overrides to `json`). In `json` mode,
  records whose message is itself a JSON object are merged into the
  envelope, so audit and request records become first-class fields
  rather than nested strings.
- **Consolidated operator config reference** at
  [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md), grouped by concern
  (transport, hardening, profiles, behaviour, logging) with the audit
  and traceability story documented end-to-end.

### Changed

- **`make dev` now requires `PORTAINER_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`.** Local HTTP dev
  loop is no longer auth-less — add the token to `.env` and pass it via
  `claude mcp add … --header "Authorization: Bearer <token>"`.

## [2.42.0] — 2026-05-22

Targets Portainer 2.42.x.

### Added

- **Maintainer release skill** at
  [`.claude/skills/portainer-mcp-release/`](.claude/skills/portainer-mcp-release/SKILL.md).
  Project-local Claude Code skill that walks through spec-bump releases
  (Portainer minor → MCP minor): finding the upstream patch target, spec
  regeneration, op/tag delta recounting, orphan inventory refresh, pin
  bumps across distribution docs, CHANGELOG promotion, commit, push,
  merge, tag. Bundles a `spec_deltas.py` script that prints the new
  per-profile coverage and orphan table paste-ready for `docs/profiles.md`.

### Changed

- **Embedded spec bumped to Portainer EE 2.42.0** (was 2.41.1). Default
  `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES` profile coverage grows from ~180 to ~197
  operations; the five-profile union grows from ~306 to ~342. Upstream
  removed the `intel` tag (6 operations); dropped from the orphan tag
  list in [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md).
- Bump `actions/checkout` to v6.0.2 and `astral-sh/setup-uv` to v8.1.0 in
  the CI and release workflows. Clears the Node.js 20 deprecation warning
  ahead of the forced Node.js 24 default on 2026-06-02.

## [2.41.0] — 2026-05-19

Initial release. Targets Portainer 2.41.x. Distributed
on PyPI as `mcp-portainer`.

### Added

- **Tool surface from the Portainer OpenAPI spec** via
  `FastMCP.from_openapi`. The patched spec (EE 2.41.1) ships inside the
  wheel at `src/portainer_mcp/data/portainer-patched.yaml`, loaded via
  `importlib.resources`. End users do not run the patcher.
- **Profile-based tag allowlist** at
  [`src/portainer_mcp/profiles.py`](src/portainer_mcp/profiles.py): five
  named bundles (`BASE`, `DOCKER`, `KUBERNETES`, `EDGE`, `ADMIN`) plus an
  `ALL` sentinel, selected via `PORTAINER_PROFILES`. Unknown profile
  names fail loudly at startup; `PORTAINER_TAGS_EXTRA` is the escape
  hatch for orphan tags. Default `BASE,DOCKER,KUBERNETES` covers ~180 of
  387 spec operations. See [`docs/profiles.md`](docs/profiles.md).
- **Orthogonal modifiers**: `PORTAINER_READ_ONLY=1` filters to `GET` /
  `HEAD` only; `PORTAINER_NO_PROXY=1` skips proxy-tool registration.
- **Universal response shaping**: every tool — generated OpenAPI tools
  and hand-written proxies alike — accepts an optional JMESPath `select`
  argument applied server-side. Implemented via
  `shaping.SelectArgTransform` (a `fastmcp.server.transforms.Transform`
  subclass) registered with `mcp.add_transform(...)`. Startup canary
  (`await mcp.list_tools()`) raises if any tool is missing `select`.
- **Response truncation hint**: `ResponseCapMiddleware` caps responses
  at `PORTAINER_MAX_RESPONSE_CHARS` (default 50000, ~80% of Claude
  Code's MCP ceiling) and appends a `select`-teaching hint with a
  concrete example before the client's own cap fires.
- **Hand-written proxy tools** for endpoints the OpenAPI spec can't
  express cleanly: `docker_proxy` and `kubernetes_proxy`, with
  validators rejecting `..` / `?` / `#` in paths and a blocked-header
  list. JMESPath projection passes through non-JSON responses unchanged
  (logs, stats, exec).
- **HTTP transport mode** via `PORTAINER_MCP_TRANSPORT=http` plus
  `PORTAINER_MCP_HTTP_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and
  `PORTAINER_MCP_HTTP_PORT` (default `8000`). Powers `make dev` — a
  long-running local server connected via
  `claude mcp add … --transport http http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` — and
  the eventual remote-container deployment.
- **Logging routed to stderr** per the MCP spec (stdio servers' logging
  surface). FastMCP banner and its version-check call to
  `pypi.org/pypi/fastmcp/json` are suppressed so deployed-server stderr
  stays ours.
- **PyPI release pipeline** at
  [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml): tag
  push (`X.Y.Z`) builds the wheel, verifies the tag matches
  `pyproject.version`, runs tests, and publishes to PyPI via OIDC-based
  Trusted Publishing. No API tokens or repo secrets. Process docs:
  [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md).
- **Maintainer spec-refresh pipeline**: `make specs VERSION=X.Y.Z`
  shallow-clones `portainer/portainer-api-docs` (SSH default,
  `UPSTREAM_REPO=` override) into `spec/upstream/` and runs
  `spec/patch_spec.py` against the requested EE YAML.
  [`spec/patch_spec.py`](spec/patch_spec.py) applies workarounds for
  known upstream spec defects (excluded operations, `/websocket/*`
  paths, malformed enums, YAML tab/`=`-tag defects).
- **Test suite + CI**: 41 tests under [`tests/`](tests/) covering the
  pure-data surface (spec patcher, shaping, proxy validators). CI runs
  `uv sync --frozen` + `uv run pytest` on push to `main` and every PR.
- **Hygiene skill** at
  [`skills/portainer-mcp-hygiene/`](skills/portainer-mcp-hygiene/) —
  guidance for MCP clients on when to project with `select`, where the
  heavy fields live, and how to handle non-JSON proxy responses.
- **FastMCP pin** at `>=3.3,<4` (the `OpenAPIProvider` import path used
  here only exists on 3.x).
- **Versioning policy** at [`docs/versioning.md`](docs/versioning.md):
  major+minor pins to Portainer's API version; patch slot is the MCP
  server's own.

### Known gaps

- **CE coverage** is best-effort. The embedded spec is EE; CE is a
  subset and operations missing from CE surface as 404s at call time.
- **Remote container deployment** (HTTP transport + auth) is not yet
  shipped. The transport switch and `make dev` workflow lay the
  groundwork; auth and a Dockerfile come after PyPI lands.
